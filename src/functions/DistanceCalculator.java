//@FunctionalInterface annottionis useful to prevent that somebody added some aditionnal methods to the 
//type that we have already used in tohter parts of the program as a type for lambda function 

// declaration of an additionnal method is notpossible for example we cannot add double calculateDDeliveryTime();
// but functionnalinterface can containas much default  methods and as much static methods as possible 

// so important to remember : ONLY ONE ABSTRACT METHOD, otherwise when using lambda expressions
// it is not clear which method we should use
